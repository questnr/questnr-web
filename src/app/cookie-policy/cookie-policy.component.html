    <h2>COOKIE POLICY</h2>
    <p><strong>Last updated&nbsp;May 27, 2020</strong></p>
    <p>This Cookie Policy explains how&nbsp;QuestNR&nbsp;("<strong>Company</strong>", "<strong>we</strong>",
      "<strong>us</strong>", and "<strong>our</strong>") uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you
      visit our websites at&nbsp;<a
        href="https://questnr.com/">https://questnr.com</a>,&nbsp;("<strong>Websites</strong>"). It explains what these
      technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.</p>
    <p>In some cases, we may use cookies to collect personal information, or that becomes personal information if we
      combine it with other information.</p>
    <p><strong>What are cookies?</strong></p>
    <p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies
      are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work or to work more efficiently, as well as to
      provide reporting information.</p>
    <p>Cookies set by the website owner (in this case,&nbsp;QuestNR) are called "first party cookies". Cookies set by
      parties other than the website owner are called "third party cookies". Third-party cookies enable third party
      features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. like advertising, interactive content,
      and analytics). The parties that set these third party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the
      website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.</p>
    <p><strong>Why do we use cookies?</strong></p>
    <p>We use first&nbsp;and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in
      order for our Websites to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other
      cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Online
      Properties.&nbsp;Third parties serve cookies through our Websites for advertising, analytics, and other
      purposes.&nbsp;This is described in more detail below.</p>
    <p>The specific types of first&nbsp;and third-party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they
      perform are described below (please note that the specific cookies served may vary depending on the specific
      Online Properties you visit):</p>
    <p><strong>How can I control cookies?</strong></p>
    <p>You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie rights by setting
      your preferences in the Cookie Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager allows you to select which categories
      of cookies you accept or reject. Essential cookies cannot be rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide
      you with services.</p>
    <p>The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the notification banner and on our website. If you choose to reject
      cookies, you may still use our website though your access to some functionality and areas of our website may be
      restricted. You may also set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. As the means by which
      you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your
      browser's help menu for more information.</p>
    <p>In addition, most advertising networks offer you a way to opt-out of targeted advertising. If you would like to
      find out more information, please visit&nbsp;<a
